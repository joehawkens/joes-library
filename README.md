# Overview

### This is a simple database web app created using Google Firebase, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Database holds information about books, hence the name "Joe's Library". Someone using the Database can Create, Read, Update, and Delete book data from the database, which is hosted on Firebase. Most people who develop with Firebase download an npm package that contains an SDK for using the Software. However, because I was having difficulties with the SDK, I decided to import all the functionality through CDN - which provides all the assets and functions of the Database through links you import inside the code. I decided to create this project to see if I could learn something new and increase my problem solving skills in understanding unfamiliar technology.

### Since this database was created using my Firebase account, there is no way for someone to use it unless they used my credentials, however, you can view all the previously mentioned functionality through the video link below:

# Future Work (things to improve and add)

* The frontend needs to be able to update the book within the user interface.
* The frontend code needs the ability to show multiple books in the library.
